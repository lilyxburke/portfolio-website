            <p>My name's Lily, a second year Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield with a huge passion for 
                game development, and this is where I showcase the projects that I have been creating in my free time.</p>
            <p>At university, my main focus is programming where I learn a variety of languages and I have used this knowledge 
                to help me when learning C# to use in conjunction with Unity.

            <h3>Dlala Studios (QA tester)</h3>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> June 2024</h5>
            <p>I undertook a week's placement at Dlala studios as part of the QA department, where I was tasked with functional testing, ensuring that projects ran as intended and keeping track of bugs using Jira.
                I tested previous bugs to see if they had been fixed and also discovered new bugs that I then had to replicate for a report. I also sat in on team meetings and took part in discussions that helped me to 
            further understand how a games studio operates and how different departments communicate. </p>
            <p>I also spoke to part of the technical team and was given an insight into the different stages of game development as well as the different tools and packages that can be used to optimise elements of Unity gameplay.</p>
